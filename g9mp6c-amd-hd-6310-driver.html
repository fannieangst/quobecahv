Is there any I could do to fix this? Here is my about:support info = http://pastebin.com/Zr2qTS4G. Примечание к пункту 3.1: UAA (KB888111) driver необходим только для Win Xp и одинаков для всех ноутбуков. Hi, first time poster here. So I have a very old laptop from around 2010 i think and I use it to play LoL and watch videos. In games I start with around 40 fps but after around 10 min into the game I barely have 10 fps which is unplayable. While watching youtube or netflix I can't even watch at 720p because it stutter. I have read LoL forums ect and many suggest that I upgrade my graphic driver but I have 0 ide how it work, thats why I ask here. I watch youtube videos how to upgrade my graphic. Ноутбук Inspiron 1. Intel. Ниже вы сможете найти рекомендации для похожей системы. Оцените этот универсальный. I have a cool ITX box that used to house an old via CPU. It's made of solid metal and could easily be used to smash someone's skull in. This thing needed to be power efficient. I'm an eco-warrior amongst other things. So I went on eBay and snagged an E350. It's a low end dualcore AMD featuring an AMD GPU. 4GB of RAM, and a mechanical drive. Now this thing is home file server grade, or media box at best, but I thought I'd persevere with a full blown OS. I love Ubuntu, so I knew the OS would. 
Если сравнивать с lga775 - тут примерно тоже самое, их предназначение и методика применения, который составил 44,9 пункта, который и выберем для выполнения пункта 2 данной инструкции. Question, how can a get xvesa working? The latest snapshot change to using spleen console font looks terrible. Capitalised x, j, i, t etc just don't look right. The change also requires modification to tput console menus as the font is larger. I have a onboard radeon/ati board that I use for graphics, so as a fix I thought I'd switch that over to just using xvesa. I boot to the boot prompt, and enter boot -c to enter the boot configuration menu and enter the command disable. Не секрет, что понять, насколько та или иная видеокарта быстрее и лучше - очень не просто. Hello, I am running Manjaro latest and greatest. Suddenly LightDM has stopped working. I have tried all I knew to try to no avail and am now reaching out for help. Below, my lightDM and Xorg log is attached: lightdm.log +0.01s DEBUG: Logging to /var/log/lightdm/lightdm.log +0.01s DEBUG: Starting Light Display Manager 1.28.0, UID=0 PID=590 +0.01s DEBUG: Loading configurat. Соответствующий продукт amd или система в сборке, содержащая соответствующий продукт amd, должны быть приобретены во время действия акции. EDIT SOLUTION: Go back to lubuntu 14.04 and install proprietary amd drivers in additional drivers. They are not available in newer distros. I have an old 2 core AMD E-350 1.6ghz (think atom-like) laptop with 4gb ram and AMD HD 6310 onboard graphics. I'd like to use it on my TV. It runs 1080p Youtube just barely on windows, and h.264 1080p with the occasional stutter. What is the best, lightest distro for me? Thanks. 
Если после обновления драйвера на видеокарту Ваш ноутбук будет работать. Щёлкам на Компьютер правой мышью и выбираем Свойства,. на вашу видеокарту nvidia, затем скачает обновленный драйвер. Update: Quick saving was causing a memory leak that led to the crashing. Ok, I was playing Kotor gog version and got 20 hours in when it started crashing every 10 minutes. That was with the Restoration mod and a new head. Tried reinstalling. Tried without mods which of course meant I couldn't use that save anymore. Switched to Steam version(own it, just was using gog cause it was touted as the most stable version. So much for that.). Still crashes roughly 10-15 minutes. I've tried nearly. Can you guys suggest me putting correct APM value for Toshiba satellite laptop so that I can ensure maximum power saving with reduced harddrive wear-and tear??? Not that I am asking how to determine the APM value for harddrive spindown to save power but I want to know the value you have placed that balanced between power-saving and harddrive life. This is what I have set but am concerned that it is not good. The laptop I am using is Toshiba Satellite C675D-S7109 with AMD 6310 HD graphics. I am trying to setup my old tower for cryptocurrency mining. It has "1 PCI Express 16 slot(only support PCIE 4 card" and I have no clue what this means. I need a newer GPU like a Nvidia 1050 or 1060, but I'm worried it won't be compatible. Cryptocurrency mining relies on the GPU for processing so I'm not as concerned about the rest of PC. Here are the specs: Series AMD Embedded CPU Dimension RS107(Dimension:280 282 95mm=7.5L;With Cardreader:CRT02) Motherboard AHD1S-K Processors Support. In the middle of last month, I installed the Windows 10 Fall Creators update on my Dell 3541 laptop. After this update, I noticed that whenever I move my touchpad or a USB wireless mouse when in normal boots of Windows 10, my desktop will freeze for about two-thirds of a second. This happens at any time, regardless of what programs are or are not running. If there's sound or video playing, it continues to run, but does not update the video image on my laptop's monitor. This does not occur. So I have installed Debian on my laptop. At first, I had Xorg issue that I solved using Xorg -configure command and moving config files to /etc/X11. Which hopefully solved the problem on AMD radeon HD 6310 graphics card using opensource radeon driver. And now, I see the following error after issuing systemctl --failed; UNIT LOAD ACTIVE SUB DESCRIPTION ● networking.service loaded failed failed Raise network interfaces To be honest, even though. I am a Windows-user ever since and very much new to Linux. I tried installing EOS on my system and it worked well. The one thing I worry about is its sluggish/delay response to applications. My question: Does my current system support EOS? I don't know if I am doing it right. I am very much needing assistance at the moment. Thank you. ------------------ System Information ------------------ Time of this report: 10/30/2016, 08:37:12 Machine name: ------ Operating System: Windows #Winner: /u/zmandevil # PROOF ( Yup, so to enter to win the stuff comment and I'll choose a random top level comment. Inventory: Onto the more mundane stuff. So I updated my driver for my graphics card (AMD Radeon HD 6310) and everything got fucked up. Don't post your trade link. My Osu! client won't display the lowest widescreen resolution properly fullscreen, and I'm getting frame lag in CS:GO. FeelsBad. Hi guys. I was given an Asus K53BY laptop with what seems to be 2 graphics cards. The one that seems to be in use is the seemingly crappier HD 6310. There is also a HD 6470M in there but I can't seem to be able to use it. I'd like to enable it to improve the video playback, which currently can't handle 720p on youtube (stuttering a lot). I'm using the xserver-xorg-video-ati drivers which are the recommended ones according to the Driver Manager. I downloaded the linux drivers 
So that's it I guess, after 4 years using Linux along with Windows 7 (I have 2 computers) I can finally say two things for sure: 1) I'm a Linux enthusiast: I vouch for Linux on the desktop computer to be prevalent at some point and I sure hope that Linux will grab Microsoft's market share. 2) I hate Linux compared to Windows. It is still not as smooth, not as snappy, not as performant, not as efficient as Windows 7. Full disclaimer: I've been running Windows since w95, so you can easily. Hey, Recently installed Ubuntu MATE 16.04 w. Win 7 on my laptop after the HD broke. (Previously dual boot- Win7 and Ubuntu 14.04) Been great so far. Decided to try out the GNOME 3 de and really like it. So much so that I'd like to keep on using it. The main issue is the radeon driver is somewhat subpar, fglrx is apparently depreciated, and my card- AMD HD 6310- isn't supported by the amdgpu pro driver. Was considering downgrading to 14.04 or switching distros (fedora or debian) but apparently. Ok first of all i am bad with PC hardware. I bought this netbook couple of years ago. It came with windows 7 and at some point i got a free windows 8.1 Pro version through my univerity and heard it uses less resources. So i thought: great way to make my Netbook faster. I didn't like windows 8 that much and because of other reasons i didnt use the Netbook for some time. Now my actual Laptop is dieing and i need my Nebook back. But it is so god damn slow. Is my Laptop not capable of handling Hello! I'm currently doing a Let's Play stream of Undertale on my Twitch channel, and for the most part, it's been smooth sailing for my laptop (it's a 4GB laptop, more specs will be below) to play and stream it via Open Broadcaster Software (OBS). However, when it got to the fight against Muffet, I had some serious lag problems. Specifically in the segments with her "pet" -- when the battle box started moving up and down, and especially when the pet itself was chasing me, the framerate First let's go over specs and equipment. Laptop: hp 2000-2b19wm 15.6" 320gb, amd e-series, 1.3ghz, 4gb Graphics: amd radeon hd 6310 Ok. Now that we've covered that, I can continue. I used to get about 30-40 fps with this device, however this was about a year ago. I've followed everything on the RS pages regarding low fps/lag. Updated everything possible. (Before updating graphics driver I was getting 6-10fps consistently, after I'm now getting 2) I'm also using the java client My computer has been crashing sporadically over the last month or so and I don't know why. I've already run Malwarebytes to check for anything and checking the Event Viewer turned out only a driver for a printer which I have already removed. When my computer crashes, it sometimes gives me a blue screen of death \(example\) ( and other times it gives me strange colored streaks \(example\) ( making me think, as a layman I have an netbook with an AMD E-240 APU with Radeon 6310 integrated GPU. This GPU gets detected by FaH, but isn't working. It is normally detected as "Display Driver", and when I try to use it it fails. I took a look at GPUs.txt, and found that it was getting detected as "Display Driver". It seems that there is a group of GPUs that have the same hardware ID, but one number off (Display Driver, HD 6310, HD 6250). I tried making it detect my GPU as a 6310, but it failed when I tried Yes, I know you can run it on pretty much everything, but I'm just curious how well it would exactly run. I'm not going to do anything too heavy with it, I have my much more powerful Windows machine for that. I'm just interested in learning my way around Linux and learn to use it as my daily driver. So the usage would be web browsing, multimedia, text editing etc. ampnbsp; The laptop is MSI X370 AMD E-350 Dual Core 1,6GHz 4GB DDR3 Radeon HD 6310 500GB.

After i recently installed windows 10 from windows 7 home premium, i notice that i cannot play any videos outside of youtube without getting a green screen effect and i can only hear audio, and i used to be able to play videos on all websites fine when i have windows 7 home premium. it does it sometimes on youtube also and i have to play around with the buffer bar to make it a proper working video again without the green screen and sound. now i use firefox, and i tried chrome and edge and still. </p>
