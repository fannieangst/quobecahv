On a high end dedi, can rTorrent / ruTorrent be tuned so it aggressively races like Deluge does? Pretty simple question really. Say you got 10gbps class 1 bandwidth, NVME SSD, big xeon, 128GB DDR4. can just rTorrent do the job for initial peering racing? At the moment on cheap slot I race in Deluge then have to move it over to rTorrent because circa 90 torrents active in Deluge really slows down the remote client AND the seeding performance.

※update: 2019-4-23: deleted Xu Sheng and added Yu Jin instead. Hi Guys. I started playing LOCCOL since 12/2018, and the first thing I was referring to, when it comes to good commanders, was this (https://www.reddit.com/r/rotklegendofcaocao/comments/86jr7j/recommended_commanders_in_order_of_unlock/). To be honest, this did give me some insight about which commanders have a better reputation than others regarding their strength, but I soon found out that it provided me more cons than pros becaus. /r/france being a french subreddit, you don't hear much about it on SRS. I thought I should effortpost about them every now and then, as I loathe how french people who arrive on reddit get greeted by the cesspool of hate that is this subreddit.

She almost reached out to catch. Congratulations on picking a great big fucking turd to fly! Make no mistake, the Q400 is just a god awful airplane. I think what I hate most about it is the air conditioning - When the bleeds aren't sending smoke from burning oil into the cabin (this is an alarmingly regular occurrence), the ACMs simply do a terrible job regulating the temperature in automatic mode, and if you put them in manual, moving the knob the width of a hair will roast you or freeze you.

I walked into the interrogation room with two cups of coffee, one cup being my own personal brew and the other one being an Irish coffee. As much as I love drinking my own special brew, I usually make an Irish coffee if I expect the interrogation to take a while and based on his file I’m sure I won’t be getting home by 6.

JLB amp#x200B; A late October rain hammers against his window. The clock struck the bottom of the hour and a terrifying pounding at his door suddenly drags him from sleep and those dreams that follow. Luis Arnett, dripping in sweat, trembling, his head spinning, sprung up in bed like an old one rising from slumber. His brown eyes, wide and veiny, hair drenched, Luis collected his breath before realizing. The beginning to the madness that has become my life. (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8q26fg/i_found_my_suicide_note_from_years_ago_i_didnt/) I stared at my phone's screen, the only source of light in my pitch black bedroom.
